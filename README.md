# California-House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using a range of machine learning regression models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Key steps include:
 - Cleaning and handling missing values in the dataset
 - Encoding categorical features and engineering new variables such as rooms per household
 - Building predictive models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, and XGBoost
 - Evaluating models using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and accuracy

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
